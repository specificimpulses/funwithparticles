# funwithparticles
This is the source code for the "Fun With Particles" app and wallpaper. I'm releasing it since it's been over five years since I've worked on it and I've moved on to other things.  Anyone interested in one approach to building computationally intense parts of an app in Fortran and glueing it to Java using C interfaces might find some usefull stuff here.. or maybe not.

Please don't expect much help if you try to build it, but I'll do what I can when I have the time.

Note that the recent deprecation of GCC in the Android NDK means a lot of what I did to add Fortran support will no longer be valid with later NDK releases.

Finally.. please don't rebuild the app or wallpaper as-is and publish to Google Play. If you want to make contributions here then I'll be happy to update the packages and give you a shout-out.  BTW.. don't expect to make money with this.  Adding a 'donate' button to the wallpaper has netted me about $3 in the 6+ years it has been out, so... ;)
